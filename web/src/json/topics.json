{"Differences Between Type Aliases and Interfaces ?":[{"title":"Differences Between Type Aliases and Interfaces?","content":"Type aliases and interfaces are similar but not the same. The key difference is that interfaces are extensible whereas type aliases are not. Type aliases are used to create a new type that is a subset of an existing type.
