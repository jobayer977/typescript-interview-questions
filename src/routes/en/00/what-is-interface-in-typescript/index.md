Interface is a blueprint of an object which is used to define the properties and methods of an object. It is used to define the structure of an object. and helpfull in type checking.

You can explicitly describe this objectâ€™s shape using an interface declaration:

```typescript
interface Person {
 firstName: string
 lastName: string
}

var person: Person = {
 firstName: 'John',
 lastName: 'Doe',
}

```
