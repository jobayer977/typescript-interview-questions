## Difference between explicit and implicit types in typescript ?

Explicit types are used when you know the type of the variable. Implicit types are used when you don't know the type of the variable.

**Explicit types**

```typescript
let name: string = "John"
let age: number = 30
let isMarried: boolean = false
```

**Implicit types**

```typescript
let name = 'John'
let age = 30
let isMarried = false

```
