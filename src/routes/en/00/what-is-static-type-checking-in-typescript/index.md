## What is static type checking in TypeScript?

It is a type system that is used to check the type of variables and functions at compile time. Used to prevent runtime errors and improve the readability of the code. Static type checking is helpful in debugging and also in writing clean and readable code and IDE intellisense features.

```typescript
const message = "hello!";
message()
//ERROR:  This expression is not callable.
```
