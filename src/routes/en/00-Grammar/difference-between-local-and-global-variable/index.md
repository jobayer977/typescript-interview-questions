## Difference between Local and Global Variable ?

**KEY DIFFERENCE**

- Local variable is declared inside a function or block scope whereas Global variable is declared outside the function.
- Local variables are created when the function has started execution and is lost when the function terminates, on the other hand, Global variable is created as execution starts and is lost when the program ends.
- Local variable doesnâ€™t provide data sharing whereas Global variable provides data sharing.
- Local variables are stored on the stack whereas the Global variable are stored on a fixed location decided by the compiler.
