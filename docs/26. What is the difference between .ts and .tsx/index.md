title: What is the difference between .ts and .tsx ?
---

`.ts` files contains only pure TypeScript
`.tsx` have included JSX also.

On another point of view, you can copy everything from a .ts file and paste on .tsx file, and you don't need to modify anything. But if you're copying from a .tsx file you need to refactor it by removing the JSX elements.
